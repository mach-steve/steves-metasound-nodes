# steves-metasound-nodes
Some Metasound graph nodes for use in Unreal Engine

As of now, the working nodes are:
  - DemoGainNode - A mono gain node that provides a basic skeleton for building your own node.
  - StereoGainNode - The stereo version of the same.
  - STremolo - A tremolo, so that you don't have to build one from multiple nodes.
